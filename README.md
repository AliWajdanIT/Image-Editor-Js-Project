# Image Editor

This is a simple image editor built using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. It lets you upload an image and apply filters like brightness, saturation, inversion, and grayscale. You can also rotate and flip the image. After editing, you can save the edited image.

## Features

Adjust brightness, saturation, inversion, and grayscale.
Rotate the image left or right by 90 degrees.
Flip the image vertically or horizontally.
Reset the filters and rotation with one click.
Save the edited image.

## How to Use

Clone or download this repository.
Open the index.html file in your browser.
Click Choose Image to upload any image.
Use the filter buttons and slider to adjust the image.
Brightness: Changes the brightness of the image.
Saturation: Makes the colors more or less vibrant.
Inversion: Inverts the colors of the image.
Grayscale: Converts the image to black and white.
Use the Rotate and Flip buttons to rotate or flip the image.
If you want to start over, click Reset Filters to reset everything.
Once you're happy with the image, click Save Image to download it.

## Project Structure

index.html: This is the main HTML file.
script.js: Contains all the JavaScript functions for handling filters and image transformations.
styles.css: (Optional) If you're using custom styles, they can be added here, but Tailwind CSS is already linked in index.html.

## Technologies Used

HTML: For the structure of the page.
JavaScript: For handling the filters, rotations, flips, and image upload.
Tailwind CSS: For the styling of the page.

## Future Improvements

### I plan to improve this project by:

Adding more filters like contrast and blur.
Improving the user interface design.
